## About me ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technically skilled and business-oriented analyst with 4 years of experience in system analysis and software development support. With a background in Computer Science and Econometrics and a strong foundation in linear algebra and probability, I am transitioning into quantum computing.

Currently focusing on quantum programming with Qiskit and PennyLane, I aim to build practical quantum machine learning applications.

Iâ€™m actively developing open-source projects, participating in quantum communities, and seeking opportunities in quantum software development, particularly in hybrid ML/QML applications.

Letâ€™s connect if you're looking for a motivated, interdisciplinary junior quantum developer or advocate!
